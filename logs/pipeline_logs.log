2025-07-04 19:32:12-Retrieval_chain_component-INFO-LLM's response: Ah, a profound question, isn’t it? In essence, philosophy is *critical thinking* distilled into a pursuit of understanding. It’s the systematic exploration of fundamental concepts – truth, morality, existence – not for comfort, but for *meaning*. It’s the bedrock upon which we build ethical frameworks, critical judgments, and ultimately, a more nuanced understanding of ourselves and the world. It’s the ongoing process of questioning *why* – and why not – we think the way we do. 

In short, philosophy helps us ask *better* questions.
